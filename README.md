Data Visualization: User's problem-solving progress is shown with animated progress circles and submission statistics are displayed on interactive cards.
Responsive Design: The interface is responsive and user-friendly, with smooth hover effects and 3D animations.
Backend API: A Flask-based backend that makes GraphQL requests to LeetCodeâ€™s API and sends the data to the frontend.
Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS (with animations), and JavaScript for dynamic user interaction.
Tech Stack:
Flask (Backend) for handling API requests.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend development.
LeetCode GraphQL API for fetching user data.
